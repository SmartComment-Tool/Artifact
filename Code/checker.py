    prompt = f'''Imagine you are a smart contract analyzer specializing in detecting inconsistencies between code and comments in functions.
Your task is to evaluate whether a function's implementation explicitly contradicts the functional logic described in its comments.
Each analysis task should be handled independently. Follow this structured process:


    Analyze all comments individually. Treat all comments as authoritative and assume they describe the intended behavior of the function accurately.
    Consider all provided function implementations, including those called by the target function and those that call the target function.

The common types of inconsistencies include:
    (1) Missing Access Controls: For instance, if the comment specifies owner-only access but the implementation lacks such control.
    (2) Missing Variable/Parameter Checks: For example, if the comment specifies input validation, but the function (or the functions it calls) does not perform the required checks. If the check is already performed in a called function, do NOT flag it as inconsistent.
    (3) Missing Key Operations: For example, if the comment specifies emitting an event, but the function (or the functions it calls) does not emit the event. If the operation is performed in a called function, do NOT flag it as inconsistent.
    (4) Incorrect Key Logic: If the implementation clearly violates the comments, such as transferring tokens to an incorrect address.
    (5) Mismatched Input/Output Interface: For example, if the comment specifies a return value, but the function does not return anything.

Focus only on inconsistencies that cause functional differences. For example, if the function has improper visibility (pure/view), but the comment does not explicitly specify the required visibility, do NOT flag it as inconsistent. Similarly, do not flag inconsistencies based on recommendations, optimizations, or ambiguous comments.
If the inconsistency arises from a missing check or operation, verify whether it is already performed in a called function. If yes, do NOT flag it as inconsistent. If the comment lacks sufficient detail to determine correctness, do NOT flag it as inconsistent.
If the comment assumes some condition will be pre-checked, but the implementation check it again, do NOT flag it as inconsistent.
If the comments are too short or ambiguous to determine whether the implementation is incorrect, do not flag as inconsistent.
You should only check the comment that explicilty provided to you. For example, if the comment is not self-contained, such as refering to external interface/documentation/links, do not flag as inconsistent.
If the comment is a suggestion/recommendation/gas-related description, do not flag as inconsistent.



Comments related to the target function are provided in a JSON list with the following fields:
- 'comment': The text of the comment.
- 'entity': The entity the comment belongs to.
- 'level': The level of the entity, which can be 'contract', 'function', 'statement', or 'variable'.
    (1) 'contract' level comments describe the overall functionality of the contract.
    (2) 'function' level comments describe the functionality of the function and are critical for detecting inconsistencies.
    (3) 'statement' level comments explain the purpose of specific statements and help in understanding the code logic.
    (4) 'variable' level comments describe the definition and usage of variables, events, or errors in Solidity.


If an inconsistency is detected, you must provide a corrected and self-contained implementation of the target function:
    (1) 'explanation': A brief reason (up to 50 words) for the inconsistency.
    (2) 'violated_comment': The specific part of the comment that the function contradicts. Concatenate multiple comments into a single string, sorted in their original order.
    (3) 'improved_implementation': A dictionary suggesting corrections. You can only modify the target function, rather than all functions in the analysis. If the target function needs changes, use its name as the key and the new implementation as the value. You need to provide the full corrected code of the target function. You corrected implementation should only use the functions that exist in the provided contract interface when modifying the code.
    The new implementation of the target function will be compiled using the Solidity compiler version {solc_version}.

You need also to verify whether other functions it internally calls have already performed this check. If yes, do NOT flag as inconsistent.
    (3) Missing Key Operations explicitly required by the comments. For example, the comment says the function should emit an event, but the function (and the function it calls) do not emit that specific event. You need also to verify whether other functions it internally calls have already performed this operation. If yes, do NOT flag as inconsistent.

    (5) Different Input/Output Interface. For example, the comment declares return value but function returns none.

You should only focus on inconsistencies that cause real functional differences. For example, if you find the function has improper visibility(pure/view), but the comment does not explictly specify it must use which visability, the inconsistency is NOT valid.

    (3) the 'statement' level comments typically explain the intended purpose of a specific statement. It can help you understand the hign-level code logic.
