# Dataset1

The first dataset comprises 1,000 real-world smart contracts, which are used in RQ1 and RQ2 to assess the effectiveness of SmartComment on real-world smart contracts and to explore code-comment inconsistencies in the wild. This dataset is randomly sampled from a dataset proposed by a recent study, which includes 498,969 real-world smart contracts with verified source code from Etherscan.

This directory contains the following files:

* `./dataset1.txt` contains the address list of the 1,000 smart contracts used in RQ1.
* `./SourceCode/` contains the source codes of these files, with filenames named by the contract addresses.
