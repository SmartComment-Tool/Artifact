# Artifacts

This repository contains the artifacts for the paper "SmartComment: Detecting Code-Comment Inconsistencies in Smart Contracts by Combining LLM and Program Analysis".

It includes the source code of SmartComment, datasets collected for analysis and experiment, and the results of the experiments.

Specifically, it includes the following content:

- [`./Code/`](https://github.com/SmartComment-Tool/Artifact/tree/main/Code): the source code of SmartComment, the first technique that combines LLMs with program analysis techniques for detecting code-comment inconsistencies in smart contracts. Please refer to [`./Code/README.md`](https://github.com/SmartComment-Tool/Artifact/tree/main/Code#readme) for detailed instructions on installation and usage.
- [`./Dataset/`](https://github.com/SmartComment-Tool/Artifact/tree/main/Dataset): dataset collected for analysis and experiment. Please refer to [`./Dataset/README.md`](https://github.com/SmartComment-Tool/Artifact/tree/main/Dataset#readme) for detailed information.
- [`./Experiment/`](https://github.com/SmartComment-Tool/Artifact/tree/main/Experiment): the results of the experiments. For detailed information on the results and instructions to replicate the experiments, please see the [`./Experiment/README.md`](https://github.com/SmartComment-Tool/Artifact/tree/main/Experiment#readme) file.
